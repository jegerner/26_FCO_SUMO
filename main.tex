\TIBabstract{%
Floating Car Observers (FCOs) are perception-equipped, connected vehicles that share object-level detections of surrounding traffic participants via V2X communication \cite{zhang2023novel,ma2021high,florin2022real}. By extending classical Floating Car Data (FCD) with onboard sensor outputs, FCOs enable mobile, infrastructure-independent traffic state estimation with broad spatial coverage, making them highly relevant for ITS applications. A key challenge is the simulation-based development of algorithms that rely on realistic detection inputs. Microscopic traffic simulators like SUMO do not natively model sensor physics or the behavior of learning-based perception systems. Existing approaches approximate FCO detectability via simple distance thresholds \cite{zhang2023novel} or 2D ray tracing \cite{Ilic2024raytracing,DuensingHoyer2025FCO}, producing simplified detections not grounded in real-world sensor capabilities and assigning only binary detected/undetected labels without capturing the uncertainty, position error, and sensor-dependent characteristics of real 3D object detectors.

To address this gap, we present a scalable neural network-based observation model \cite{gerner2023sumodetector,IV2024} that emulates state-of-the-art 3D object detectors directly within SUMO. Training data is generated through synchronized SUMO--CARLA \cite{CARLA2017} co-simulation, where observer vehicles carry virtual camera and LiDAR sensors following the NuScenes setup \cite{nuscenes}. Fine-tuned 3D detection models covering LiDAR-only, camera-only, and multimodal configurations produce detections that capture realistic imperfections including localization error and missed detections. A lightweight neural network, trained on abstract scene representations natively available in SUMO---capturing surrounding traffic participants and infrastructure geometry---reproduces these detection outcomes at runtime without high-fidelity rendering or costly detector inference. This enables large-scale SUMO simulations with realistic FCO perception: evaluation runs in under 10\,ms per FCO, on par with 2D ray tracing, while achieving over 93\,\% detection accuracy compared to CARLA ground truth.

At the conference, we present via a poster and live demonstration how the detection module is trained, illustrating the full process from co-simulation to scalable detection. The module and trained weights are shared as open source (\url{https://github.com/urbanAIthi/fco}, first version) to enable other researchers to use FCO detection for traffic sensing and general detection-based use cases in SUMO.%
